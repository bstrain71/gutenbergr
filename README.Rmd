Download and process public domain works from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) collection. Includes

* A function `gutenberg_download()` that downloads one or more works from Project Gutenberg by ID: e.g., `gutenberg_download(84)` downloads the text of Frankenstein.
* Metadata for all Project Gutenberg works as R datasets, so that they can be searched and filtered:
  * `gutenberg_metadata` contains information about each work, pairing Gutenberg ID with title, author, language, etc
  * `gutenberg_authors` contains information about each author, such as aliases and birth/death year
  * `gutenberg_subjects` contains pairings of works with Library of Congress subjects and topics

### Installation

Install the package with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gutenbergr")
```

Or install the development version using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/gutenbergr")
```

### Examples

The `gutenberg_works()` function retrieves, by default, a table of metadata for all unique English-language Project Gutenberg works that have text associated with them. (The `gutenberg_metadata` dataset has all Gutenberg works, unfiltered).

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(dplyr.width = 140)
options(width = 100)
```

Suppose we wanted to download Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights." We could find the book's ID by filtering:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(gutenbergr)

gutenberg_works() %>%
  filter(title == "Wuthering Heights")

# or just:
gutenberg_works(title == "Wuthering Heights")
```

Since we see that it has `gutenberg_id` 768, we can download it with the `gutenberg_download()` function:

```{r}
wuthering_heights <- gutenberg_download(768)
wuthering_heights
```

`gutenberg_download` can download multiple books when given multiple IDs. It also takes a `meta_fields` argument that will add variables from the metadata.

```{r}
# 1260 is the ID of Jane Eyre
books <- gutenberg_download(c(768, 1260), meta_fields = "title")
books

books %>%
  count(title)
```

It can also take the output of `gutenberg_works` directly. For example, we could get the text of all Aristotle's works, each annotated with both `gutenberg_id` and `title`, using:

```{r}
aristotle_books <- gutenberg_works(author == "Aristotle") %>%
  gutenberg_download(meta_fields = "title")

aristotle_books
```

### FAQ

#### What do I do with the text once I have it?

* The [Natural Language Processing CRAN View](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=NaturalLanguageProcessing) suggests many R packages related to text mining, especially around the [tm package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tm).
* The [tidytext](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) package is useful for tokenization and analysis, especially since gutenbergr downloads books as a data frame already.
* You could match the `wikipedia` column in `gutenberg_author` to Wikipedia content with the [WikipediR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=WikipediR) package or to pageview statistics with the [wikipediatrend](https://cran.r-project.org/package=wikipediatrend) package.
* If you're considering an analysis based on author name, you may find the [humaniformat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=humaniformat) (for extraction of first names) and [gender](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gender) (prediction of gender from first names) packages useful. (Note that humaniformat has a `format_reverse` function for reversing "Last, First" names).

#### How were the metadata R files generated?

See the [data-raw](data-raw) directory for the scripts that generate these datasets. As of now, these were generated from [the Project Gutenberg catalog](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Feeds#The_Complete_Project_Gutenberg_Catalog) on **`r format(attr(gutenberg_metadata, "date_updated"), '%d %B %Y')`**.

#### Do you respect the rules regarding robot access to Project Gutenberg?

Yes! The package respects [these rules](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Information_About_Robot_Access_to_our_Pages) and complies to the best of our ability. Namely:

* Project Gutenberg allows wget to harvest Project Gutenberg using [this list of links](http://www.gutenberg.org/robot/harvest?filetypes[]=html). The gutenbergr package visits that page once to find the recommended mirror for the user's location.
* We retrieve the book text directly from that mirror using links in the same format. For example, Frankenstein (book 84) is retrieved from `http://www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/8/84/84.zip`.
* We retrieve the .zip file rather than txt to minimize bandwidth on the mirror.

Still, this package is *not* the right way to download the entire Project Gutenberg corpus (or all from a particular language). For that, follow [their recommendation](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Information_About_Robot_Access_to_our_Pages) to use wget or set up a mirror. This package is recommended for downloading a single work, or works for a particular author or topic.
